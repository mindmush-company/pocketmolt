 Task 1 learned: - Used non-interactive Next.js init to avoid npm naming constraints (renamed dir to lowercase) - Integrated shadcn/twitter theme and Supabase boilerplate - Created browser/server Supabase clients and env example - Verified Twitter blue via app/globals.css using shadow color variable - Dev server started on port 3000; build success; committed changes.

- Next steps planned: ensure .env.local is populated with real keys; implement basic auth flow using Supabase; extend app routing for login/register if needed.
